A demo template for the Then & Now photo gallery app we made for Spokesman.com. We're big fans of The New York Times Then & Now photo widget, so we made a Django+jQuery app for our site.

NYT example: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/09/world/europe/20091109-berlinwallthennow.html

Spokesman-Review example: http://www.spokesman.com/then-and-now/1910-fires/

Demo site for this code: http://ryanpitts.com/projects/then-now-gallery/
